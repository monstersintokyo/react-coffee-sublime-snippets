# Sublime react snippets for CoffeeScript

I know, CoffeeScript is all 2012 and whatnot. Freshly brewed coffee with react sugar is still yummy.

Inspired by [atom-react](https://github.com/orktes/atom-react)


## Installation

There are currently two methods to install the snippets:

* clone the repository into your Sublime packages directory. If you don't know where to find the directory, go to *Preferences* > *Browse Packages...* in Sublime. `git clone https://github.com/monstersintokyo/react-coffee-sublime-snippets.git`

* or download the .zip file and unzip it into your packages directory.
